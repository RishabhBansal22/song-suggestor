# UI and Responsiveness Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Desktop Layout Issues**
- ❌ **Problem**: Container was only 600px wide, couldn't fit 3 song cards side by side
- ✅ **Solution**: 
  - Increased main container max-width to 1200px
  - Kept upload form (main-card) at 600px and centered it
  - Moved results section outside main-card to allow full-width display
  - Used CSS Grid with `auto-fit` for flexible responsive layout

### 2. **Mobile Horizontal Scroll Issues**
- ❌ **Problem**: Cards overflowing, scroll not working properly, improper margins
- ✅ **Solution**:
  - Fixed card widths to `calc(100vw - 2rem)` for proper viewport sizing
  - Adjusted carousel margins and padding for clean scroll experience
  - Added `max-width` constraints to prevent overflow
  - Ensured scroll container has proper negative margins for edge-to-edge scroll

### 3. **Text Size Issues**
- ❌ **Problem**: Song titles and artists were too large for card layout (2rem, 1.2rem)
- ✅ **Solution**:
  - Reduced song title to 1.4rem (desktop) and 1.3rem (mobile)
  - Reduced artist name to 1rem (desktop) and 0.95rem (mobile)
  - Added line-height for better text wrapping
  - Made summary text smaller (0.95rem) for better fit

### 4. **Spacing and Padding Issues**
- ❌ **Problem**: Inconsistent spacing, elements too cramped or too spread out
- ✅ **Solution**:
  - Standardized card padding (2rem desktop, 1.5rem mobile)
  - Added proper margins for scroll instruction
  - Fixed carousel negative margins for mobile
  - Centered IG preview section with max-width

### 5. **Overflow and Container Issues**
- ❌ **Problem**: Results section constrained by main-card width, causing layout issues
- ✅ **Solution**:
  - Moved results section outside main-card in HTML
  - Added dedicated max-width and centering to results section
  - Made IG preview max-width 600px and centered
  - Set songs carousel to full available width

## Layout Structure (Fixed)

```
.container (max-width: 1200px)
├── .main-card (max-width: 600px, centered) ← Upload form
│   ├── Upload area
│   ├── Options
│   └── Submit button
│
└── .results (max-width: 1200px, full width) ← Now outside main-card
    ├── .ig-preview-section (max-width: 600px, centered)
    │   └── IG story mockup
    ├── .scroll-instruction (mobile only)
    ├── .songs-carousel
    │   └── .songs-container
    │       ├── .song-card (1 of 3)
    │       ├── .song-card (2 of 3)
    │       └── .song-card (3 of 3)
    └── .try-again-section
```
